		<h2>Profile</h2>
		<p>I am a highly motivated individual, who enjoys working with technology.
			My strongest point is UNIX/Linux server administration and programming
			for these platforms. I have extensive experience writing shell scripts
			to accomplish new tasks. As well as maintaining and working with open source
			software to do web serving, e-mail and databases. I have also completed network
			security testing for a university. My interests lie in various different areas,
			including electronics, hardware and embedded systems. I am going to school for 
			a degree in Software Engineering, computer programming.</p>
		<p>I am from the Netherlands, and as such bring a unique perspective
			to any team. Having lived in and travelled to many countries I am
			very open to new cultures and ideas. I have resided in the US for the last 9 years,
			and during that time have met many people that I enjoyed working with.</p>

		<h2>Projects</h2>
		<p>These are the projects I am currently involved in, or have been involved in.</p>
		<p>
			<h3>Near Space</h3>
			<p>As a team of 15 students we developed a near space pay-load along with the various science experiments. With a GPS device
				TNC and a HAM radio on-board we were able to track the near space pay-load using APRS data that was being sent back. 
				After retrieving the pay-load we were able to retrieve the science data along with the pictures that we had taken with
				a still camera.
			</p>
			<h3>Christmas Tree Hack</h3>
			<p>I worked together with a team of other students at my university to set up an embedded web server running on
				the parallax PINK system, to control the christmas tree remotely. The PINK talked to an BS2 stamp which in turn
				controlled a relay box that allowed us to individually turn certain sections of the tree on and off
