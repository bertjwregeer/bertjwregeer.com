            <h2>Profile</h2>
            <p>I am a highly motivated individual, someone who enjoys exploring
            new technology and applying the knowledge gained in new and exciting
            ways. My strongest point is my knowledge of the UNIX/Linux system
            environment with strong administration skills as well as knowledge
            of the systems themselves. C++ and Python are currently the two
            programming languages I know best, like any good programmer I am
            easily able to master new programming languages. I've worked with
            customers on many different projects and helped solve difficult
            problems they were facing. Other interests include electronics
            (hardware engineering), embedded systems and network security. 
            I am knowledgeable in writing secure software that doesn't contain
            common pitfalls that lead to vulnerable software.</p>

            <p>These are the projects I am currently involved in, or have been involved in.</p>
            <p>
            <h3>Near Space</h3>
            <p>As a team of 15 students we developed a near space pay-load along
            with the various science experiments. With a GPS device TNC and a
            HAM radio on-board we were able to track the near space pay-load
            using APRS data that was being sent back.  After retrieving the
            pay-load we were able to retrieve the science data along with the
            pictures that we had taken with a still camera.  </p>
            <h3>Open Source</h3>
            <p>I am a big proponent and supporter of Open Source software, a lot
            of the software I've written is available for free from my <a
                href="https://github.com/">Github</a> page located at <a
                href="https://github.com/bertjwregeer/">https://github.com/bertjwregeer/</a>.
            This includes my most recent samples of code.
