<h1>Projects</h1>
<ul class="projects">
<li><a href="/Project/ChristmasTree.html" alt="Christmas Tree">Christmas Tree</a><p>During the Christmas season UAT put a Christmas tree in the commons area which is where all of the computers are located, where it is visible throughout most of the schools ground floor. A group of students modified the Christmas tree to be accessible from the internet using a BASIC Stamp and a PINK. After the modification the Christmas tree was able to be turned on or off from the web.</p></li>
<li><a href="/Project/LEDWall.html" alt="LED Whiteboard">LED Whiteboard</a><p>The idea was brought up at UAT to have a backlit 'whiteboard' which would allow students to post their ideas, drawings and other thoughts. The project was eventually changed so that it would be LED backlit in a grid. We used blue LED's in a 8 by 26 grid. We then also wrote the code for an SX28 microprocessor to have the LED wall play the game of life.</p></li>
<li><a href="/Project/NearSpace.html" alt="Near Space">Near Space</a><p>Professor Ryan Clarke had seen a presentation by L. Paul Verhage at Parallax about Near Space balloons. Ryan had always wanted to launch a near space balloon and created a special topics class  at UAT to do so. He selected 15 students to be part of the class, with the goal of getting a payload of 12 pounds up to at least 90,000 ft. It was a great success, our first balloon hit 92,999 ft. Our second balloon was successfully launched and retrieved!</p></li>
<li><a href="/Project/Miscellaneous.html" alt="Miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</a><p>These are the projects that were done for classes and or are not as big as the ones above. This includes many pieces of sample code that I have written along with descriptions of what they do.</p></li></ul>
